 * Normally this shouldn't be necessary, however, due to unforseen consequences
 * of creating block snapshots, there are corner cases where mod authors are
 * setting nulls into the compound for their tile entities. This overwrite
 * prevents an NPE crashing the game. A pretty warning message will be printed
 * out for the client to see and report to both Sponge and the mod author.
