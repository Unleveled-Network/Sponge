     * @reason Due to the need to fail fast and return out of this falling block
     * entity's update if the block change is cancelled, we need to inject after
     * the world.setBlockToAir is called and potentially tell the callback to
     * cancel. Unfortunately, there's no way to just blindly checking if the block
     * was changed, because the duality of bulk and single block tracking being
     * a possibility. So, we have to do the following:
     * - check if we're throwing the event that would otherwise trigger a block capture
     * - If the current phase state allows for bulk capturing, the block will be
     *   in the capture supplier, and we can just blindly throw the processing
     *   of that block(s)
     * - If the processing is cancelled, kill this entity
     * - If we're doing single capture throws, well, double check the block state
     *   on the world, and if it's not air, well, it's been either replaced, or
     *   cancelled. If it's replaced/cancelled, then don't allow this entity to
     *   live.
